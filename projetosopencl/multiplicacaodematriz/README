Adventures in OpenCL: Part 1.5
http://enja.org

Getting Started: building and running a minimalist kernel (with C++ headers)
This is the same code as part1, just converted to use OpenCL C++ Bindings.

Build:
make a build directory and build the tutorial
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make

execute the example program
./part1.x


NOTES:
Followed this tutorial to convert from C headers to C++
